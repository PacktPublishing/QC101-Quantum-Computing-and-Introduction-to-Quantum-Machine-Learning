Computing Eigen Values
In quantum computing, you will be given the eigen vectors and you will need to compute the eigen values. Finding eigen values is simple - just multiply the matrix by the eigen vector, and then factor out the eigen value from the result.

Finding eigen vectors involves complex simultaneous equations. Fortunately, you will not need to compute eigen vectors while programming quantum computers.
