Introduction to Quantum Physics
The video lessons that follow in this section will provide you with an intuitive understanding of quantum physics.

Quantum physics is difficult for us to experience with simple experiments because it usually deals with the behavior of extremely small particles.

But quantum physics also governs the behavior of light. We can understand quantum physics by studying how light behaves.

Light has a property called polarization. Photons of light are polarized at a specific angle. We can perform experiments with polarizers that alter the polarization of light.

The fundamental unit of quantum computation is a 'quantum bit' or qubit. Polarized photons behave like qubits. By studying polarization of light, we can understand how qubits behave.
